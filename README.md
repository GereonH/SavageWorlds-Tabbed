Savage Worlds Tabbed Sheet
==========================

This character sheet is designed to be tabbed with minimal skills preset. The sheet also contains an Ally/Mook character sheet and that can be accessed by clicking on the button in the upper left-hand corner of the character sheet. Note: The Ally/Mook sheet uses the same attributes as the Wild Card sheet, so, it cannot be used by two different characters simultaneously.
